# 👽 Aliasist Files Abductor (v3.0)

A slick little **Electron** desktop app that “abducts” files from URLs across the galaxy — including streaming targets routed through **yt-dlp**.

Built with a custom animated splash screen, a custom draggable title bar, download progress tracking, and a healthy amount of alien humor.

## Requirements

### For running locally
- **Node.js** (LTS recommended)
- **npm**
- **Electron** (installed via `npm install`)

### For streaming downloads (YouTube, etc.)
Your system must have:

- **Python 3** available as `python`
- **yt-dlp** installed  
  ```bash
  pip install -U yt-dlp
  ```
- A supported **JavaScript runtime** for yt-dlp (recommended: **Deno**)  
  ```powershell
  irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
  ```
- **ffmpeg** (required for merging bestvideo+bestaudio into mp4)  
  - Download: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
  - Ensure `ffmpeg` is on PATH:
    ```bash
    ffmpeg -version
    ```

If these aren’t installed, direct downloads will still work — only streaming targets may fail.

## Install & Run (Development)

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Build (Windows)

This project uses **electron-builder**.

```bash
npm run build
```

### Common Windows Build Issue (symlink privileges)

Fix by either:
- running your terminal as **Administrator**, or
- enabling **Windows Developer Mode**.
