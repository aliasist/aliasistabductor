## 🧠 Technical Case Study

### The Challenge: Cloudflare SPA Routing
Deploying a Single Page Application (SPA) to Cloudflare often results in `404 Not Found` errors when a user refreshes a sub-page. 

**The Solution:** I implemented a robust routing configuration within `vite.config.ts` and utilized Cloudflare's redirect rules to ensure all requests are handled by `index.html`. This allows the client-side router to maintain state without server-side interruptions.

### Performance Optimization
To ensure a premium user experience, I used an AI-assisted workflow to refactor the animation logic in `index.css`. This offloaded the repetitive task of writing browser-specific keyframes, allowing me to focus on the core downloading engine.
